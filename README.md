# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, GettingandCleaningDataProject.R, does the following:

-It loads the training and test datasets, only keeping the columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation

-It loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

-It merges two datasets and converts the activity and subject columns into factors

-Lastly, it creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.


The end result is shown in the file TidyData.txt.
